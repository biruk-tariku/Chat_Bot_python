# Chat_Bot_python

a chatbot that can engage in conversations. Here's a summary of what the code does:

1. It creates a chatbot named "My Bot" using `ChatBot("My Bot")`.

2. It uses the `ChatterBotCorpusTrainer` to train the chatbot on English greetings and conversations using the `trainer.train` method.

3. It enters a loop where the user can input text, and the chatbot responds accordingly.

4. If the user enters "exit," the loop breaks, and the program exits.

5. The chatbot responds to user input using `bot.get_response(user_input)` and prints the response.

Make sure you have the ChatterBot library installed (`pip install chatterbot`) and the necessary language data downloaded if it's not already downloaded automatically.

The chatbot should work as expected, engaging in conversations based on the training data provided by the ChatterBot library. It will continue to interact with the user until the user enters "exit" to quit the loop.
